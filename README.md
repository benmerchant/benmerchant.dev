# Ben MErchant dot dev
*My professional portfolio*


## Update 12:50 on a Thursday, March 21 2019

First commit was three days ago. Just deployed a bare bones effort to AWS. 

Packages/Modules/Frameworks/Libraries that, prior to Monday, I had zero experience with:
* `webpack`
* `babel`
* `uiRouter`

In a previous project, I had used AngularJS. That was my capstone course for graduating college: [Start POS: front-end](https://github.com/benmerchant/StartPOS-frontend) / [Start POS: back-end](https://github.com/benmerchant/StartPOS-backend), an all-encompassing CMS for today's busy restaurant owner. Upon viewing that project (or this one) one my think that it is no where near complete and looks like someone didn't really try. tl;dr: I taught myself `MEAN` from top to bottom in four months (excluding some previous dabblings). My teacher and his boss were both thoroughly impressed and awarded me an A for the course. I do plan to go back and polish it up. 

Enough about Start POS.

#### Where are we on [benmerchant.dev](benmerchant.dev)?

1. The basic skeleton is laid out
1. Concerns are pretty much separated
1. Adhering to AngularJS and Google/Airbnb style guides as much as possible
1. I have learned a lot and notices some opportunities
   1. Some packages with only a handful of contributors would be a good place to start working with others on projects
   1. Learning more about git, npm, and node (started using branches.. *gasp*!)
   1. I need to comment my code more
   1. I'm not much of a graphic designer, and don't enjoy spending much time on that so sorry its ugly

Next, I need to spin up a database instance and hack together a webservice through which I can communicate with it. I really wanted to learn new things for this part as well, specifically, I didn't want to use `Express` at all. However, time is of the essence and with that urgency in mind, I am going to clone [Start POS: back-end](https://github.com/benmerchant/StartPOS-backend). 

#### I need to get back to work. Some questions/tasks moving forward:

- [ ] Is it common practice to package front and back ends together? If so, how?
- [ ] What all do I need to .gitignore so that no one will try to ruin my website?
- [ ] What are some interesting things I can do to display coming of age `JavaScript`/`Node` prowess?
- [ ] Transcribe my webdev journals for blog posts. 


I'm putting in my 10,000 hours. I'd guess that I'm 15% of the way there.
